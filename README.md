## find_duplicate_files.py
* Was written to deal with a large number of duplicate images from various data dumps and backups. 
* Finds duplicate files in a directory based on the hash of the file. This means the files can have different names and the duplicate will still be found. 
* Lists out the files, asks user to select which one to keep by entering an ID number. 's' can be entered to show the file (if it is an image)
* Have run in windows 7 with python 2.7
